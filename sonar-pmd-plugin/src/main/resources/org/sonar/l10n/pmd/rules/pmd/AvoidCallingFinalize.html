<p>
  The method <code>Object.finalize()</code> is called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection determines that there are no more references to the object.
  It should not be invoked by application logic.
</p>
<p>
  Note that Oracle has declared <code>Object.finalize()</code> as deprecated since JDK 9.

<p>
  This rule is deprecated, use {rule:squid:ObjectFinalizeCheck} instead.
