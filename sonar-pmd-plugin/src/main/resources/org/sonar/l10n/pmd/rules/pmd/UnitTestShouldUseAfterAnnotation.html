In JUnit 3, the tearDown method was used to clean up all data entities required in running tests.
JUnit 4 skips the tearDown method and executes all methods annotated with @After after running each test Example:
<pre>
public class MyTest {
    public void tearDown() {
        bad();
    }
}
public class MyTest2 {
    @After public void tearDown() {
        good();
    }
}
</pre>
