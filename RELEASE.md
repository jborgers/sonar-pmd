# Create release

To create a new release, set git tag with new version number and push the tag.
The Github Actions `release.yml` will build and release to Github actions and Maven Central.

Make sure that all commits have been pushed and build 
with `build.yml` workflow before setting and pushing the tag.

## Preparation

### Update PMD rules (if needed)
If the PMD version has been updated or rules have changed, regenerate the rules-java.xml file:
```
./mvnw generate-resources -Pgenerate-pmd-rules -pl sonar-pmd-plugin
```
This will run the Groovy script that extracts rules from PMD and generates the rules-java.xml file in the correct location.

## Release Steps
- create release notes in `CHANGELOG.md`, update `..master` to `..x.y.z`; and update `README.md`
- commit both
- `git tag x.y.z`
- `git push --tags`

The release workflow will be triggered, using the git tag for `-Drevision=<tag>`. 

- manually release staging repo in [Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org/#welcome) for Maven Central
- manually change Github actions release from draft to final and limit the changelog here: [releases](https://github.com/jborgers/sonar-pmd/releases) 

Next prepare for next SNAPSHOT:

- change `revision` property in `x.y.z+1-SNAPSHOT` in parent pom
- prepare `CHANGELOG.md` for `x.y.z+1-SNAPSHOT`
- commit and push with comment "Prepare release x.y.z+1-SNAPSHOT"

When release fails before "release staging in Sonatype"
- drop staging repo
- `git tag -d x.y.z` or delete tag in IntelliJ
- `git push origin :refs/tags/x.y.z` or delete tag in context menu, delete remotes
- fix-commit-push and start release again with tagging steps above

In GitHub:

- close milestone `x.y.z`
- create new milestone `x.y.z+1`
