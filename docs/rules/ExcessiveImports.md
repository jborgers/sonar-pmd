**Category:** `pmd`<br/>
**Rule Key:** `pmd:ExcessiveImports`<br/>
> :warning: This rule is **deprecated** in favour of [S1200](https://rules.sonarsource.com/java/RSPEC-1200).

-----

A high number of imports can indicate a high degree of coupling within an object. Rule counts the number of unique imports and reports a violation if the count is above the user defined threshold.

<p>
  This rule is deprecated, use {rule:squid:S1200} instead.
