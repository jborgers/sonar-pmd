# SwitchDensity
**Category:** `pmd`<br/>
**Rule Key:** `pmd:SwitchDensity`<br/>
> :warning: This rule is **deprecated** in favour of [S1151](https://rules.sonarsource.com/java/RSPEC-1151).

-----

A high ratio of statements to labels in a switch statement implies that the switch statement is doing too much work. Consider moving the statements into new methods, or creating subclasses based on the switch variable.

  This rule is deprecated, use {rule:squid:S1151} instead.
