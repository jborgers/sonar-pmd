**Category:** `pmd`<br/>

> :warning: This rule is **deprecated** in favour of [S1186](https://rules.sonarsource.com/java/RSPEC-1186).

-----

<p>Uncommented Empty Method finds instances where a method does not contain statements, but there is no comment. By
  explicitly commenting empty methods it is easier to distinguish between intentional (commented) and unintentional
  empty methods.</p>

<p>
  This rule is deprecated, use {rule:squid:S1186} instead.
